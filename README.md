tinymce-wordcount-maxlength
===========================

A TinyMCE plugin, forked from the wordcount plugin to also display error message when character count is past set limit.

I didn't enforce a strict limit where the user can't type anything else because they don't see all the html/css that goes into the editor and counts towards the character count.
